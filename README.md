# A Hands-off Control Algorithm HDL Implementation Using Vitis HLS

In this repository you can find the HDL implementation of the self-triggering Hands-off Control algorithm - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7150354/references#references along with the MATLAB implementation, used as a reference model. The HDL design was further optimized to fully fit on a PYNQ-Z1 development board, and to comply with imposed timing constraints.

More details regarding the control problem, the solver, the proposed hardware architecture and the optimization brought to the algorithm can be found in the article named “A Hands-off Control Algorithm FPGA Implementation Using Vitis HLS”, posted on the AMIQ Consulting blog post. The complete documentation of this project can be found in the PDF file containted in this repository, named: "A_Hands_off_Control_Algorithm_HDL_Implementation_Using_Vitis_HLS_Tony_Stavarache".
